This is an environment to run dApps using [CF.js](../cf.js). It allows to showcase different demo apps, presenting a variety of use cases where state channels are applicable.

## Usage

For the moment, this package is available as a local app _(hosted version coming soon!)_.

**Make sure you have Yarn v1.10.1**. Refer to [Yarn's installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for setup instructions for your operating system.

To install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

To run the Playground:

```shell
yarn start
```

This will build the application and open a `webpack-dev-server` instance in your preferred browser, while watching the source files for any changes.
