# Protocols

A protocol is defined as the set of instructions executed and messages exchanged between a set of parties to achieve an outcome (e.g., installing a new state channel application). Instructions executed include producing digital signatures, reading persistent state to disk, etc.

Counterfactual writes client software that speak the same Counterfactual protocol, specified in the following page.

Many protocols are specialized to two-party and specified as such. We plan to extend them to n-party channels in the future.

## Protocol Structure

A protocol consists of the following components:

- **Exchange**. The protocol exchange is the series of messages exchanged between all parties in the state channel, as well as dependencies between messages.

- **Message**. A message is the set of information that must be exchanged by the parties to recreate and validate the commitment signatures and associated transactions that those signatures enable. Each protocol may in general contain multiple message types.

- **Commitments**. A protocol produces one or more commitments. Both the signatures and the data contained within the commitments must be stored.

> Note: Messages are represented as JSON-encoded objects; the transport layer should be able to reliably send and receive such messages.

### Commitment Structure

- **Signature**. The resultant data generated by computing a cryptographic signature over some hash representing the transaction to be executed.

- **Data**. Supplementary data that that allows any party in the protocol to reconstruct the hash and thus verify the signature.

- **Transaction Digest**. The transaction digest is the hash that is signed by each party, enabling the protocol's transaction to be executed on-chain. The calldata, if present, is used to generate the digest.

- **Transaction**. The transaction is the `(to, val, data, op)` tuple that a given protocol allows one to broadcast on-chain. These transactions enforce commitments created from the calldata and signature digests, manifesting the off-chain counterfactual state into the on-chain reality.

## JSON

This type specifies a modification of JSON that disallows the following primitive types: `true`, `false`, `null`. Note that when represented in javascript, large numbers which fit into `uint256` must be represented as either `BigNumber`s or as serialized `BigNumber`s (e.g., `{ _hex: '0x01'}`).

**Type: `CfAppInterface`**

| Field            | Type               | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`        | `address`          | The on-chain address of the `AppDefinition` contract implementing the application logic              |
| `stateEncoding`  | `string`           | The ABIEncoderV2 representation of the application's state encoding (e.g., `"tuple(address,uint8)"`) |
| `actionEncoding` | `Optional<string>` | The ABIEncoderV2 representation of the application's action encoding, if it exists                   |
