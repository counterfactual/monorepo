>Yay! You're creating a new issue. Keep in mind these guidelines:
>
>- Set the title following this convention:
>
>    [feature-group] [summary]
>
>    where:
>
>    - `feature-group` represents either a monorepo package, or other features such as "documentation" or "lint".
>    - `summary` is a one-sentence version of the issue description.
>
> - Tag the PR appropriately:
>   - If you're interested in discussing something in particular, use the "question" label.
>   - If you're reporting something that doesn't look right in the repo, use the "bug" or "invalid" labels
>     _(bug = something's broken, invalid = something's weird)_.
>   - If it's related to a package, use the corresponding label (i.e. _"Package: machine"_).
>   - If what you're discussing has dependencies with other contributors or external circumstances, tag it with the "waiting" label.
>
> Once you're good to go, delete these guidelines :)
